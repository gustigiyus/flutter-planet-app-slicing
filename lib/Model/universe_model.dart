        "Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, it is the smallest in the solar system and has a heavily cratered surface similar to the Moon. Its thin atmosphere leads to extreme temperature fluctuations, with scorching days and freezing nights. Mercury's lack of atmosphere means it cannot retain heat, resulting in temperatures ranging from -173°C at night to 427°C during the day.",

        "Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is similar in size and structure to Earth, earning it the title of Earth's 'sister planet'. However, its thick atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide with clouds of sulfuric acid, creates a runaway greenhouse effect, making its surface the hottest in the solar system at around 465°C. Venus rotates very slowly and in the opposite direction to most planets, meaning its day is longer than its year.",

It has a balanced atmosphere composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, which sustains a wide variety of ecosystems. Earth's surface is 71% water, which plays a crucial role in regulating its climate. The planet's diverse geology includes mountains, valleys, and volcanoes, and its dynamic weather systems contribute to its rich biodiversity.",

Mars hosts the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, and the deepest canyon, Valles Marineris. Although it has a thin atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, evidence suggests that Mars once had liquid water on its surface, raising questions about past life.",

Its most notable feature is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has persisted for centuries. Jupiter has at least 79 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system, which is even bigger than the planet Mercury. Jupiter's powerful magnetic field and numerous moons make it a mini solar system of its own.",

        "Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun, is classified as an ice giant due to its composition of water, ammonia, and methane ices. It has a blue-green color because of methane in its atmosphere. Uranus is unique because it rotates on its side, with its axis nearly parallel to its orbit, possibly due to a colossal collision early in its history. This unusual tilt causes extreme seasonal variations. Uranus has at least 27 moons and faint rings.",

Neptune is known for its strong winds and storms, including the Great Dark Spot, a storm comparable to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Neptune has at least 14 moons, with Triton being the largest. Triton is geologically active, with geysers of nitrogen, and orbits the planet in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation, indicating it may have been captured from the Kuiper Belt.",
